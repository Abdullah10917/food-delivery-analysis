# Food Delivery Data Analysis Hackathon

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook created for a food delivery data analysis hackathon.  
The notebook demonstrates loading and merging datasets from multiple formats (CSV, JSON, and SQL) and performing analysis on the final combined dataset.

The analysis focuses on:
- Order trends over time  
- User behavior patterns  
- Membership impact (Gold vs Regular)  
- City-wise and cuisine-wise performance  
- Revenue distribution and seasonality  

The final merged dataset is treated as the single source of truth for all insights and answers.
